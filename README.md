This project contains 15 SQL queries ranging from basic to advanced, executed on the ClassicModels dataset. It demonstrates practical database skills through tasks such as data retrieval, aggregation, reporting, and performance optimization.

The SQL Practice Project â€“ ClassicModels Database is a hands-on portfolio project designed to demonstrate practical expertise in MySQL and relational database management. Using the ClassicModels sample dataset, I developed and executed 15 SQL queries ranging from basic retrievals to advanced multi-table joins and nested subqueries.

The project covers a wide spectrum of SQL concepts, including:

Data Retrieval & Filtering â€“ Applying SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, and LIMIT for efficient data extraction.

Aggregation & Grouping â€“ Utilizing GROUP BY, HAVING, and aggregate functions for business reporting.

Joins & Relationships â€“ Implementing INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and RIGHT JOIN to combine multiple datasets.

Advanced Queries â€“ Creating nested queries, complex conditions, and performance-optimized SQL statements.

ðŸŽ¯ Objective:
To simulate real-world database operations and strengthen problem-solving skills by answering practical business questions through SQL.

ðŸ’¼ Relevance:
This project reflects my readiness to work on Data Analysis, Database Development, and Business Intelligence tasks in a professional setting, delivering actionable insights from structured datasets.

ðŸ’¼ Open to work â€” Seeking opportunities in Data Analysis, Database Development, and Software Engineering.
